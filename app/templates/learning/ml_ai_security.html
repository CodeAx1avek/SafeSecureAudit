      <h1>ML & AI Security</h1>
      <div class="scrollable-content">
        <p>
          ML & AI security focuses on protecting machine learning (ML) and
          artificial intelligence (AI) systems from cyber threats,
          vulnerabilities, and attacks. As ML & AI technologies are increasingly
          integrated into critical applications and decision-making processes,
          ensuring their security and resilience is essential to prevent misuse,
          manipulation, and compromise of data and models.
        </p>

        <h2>Challenges in ML & AI Security:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class="emphasis">Data Poisoning:</span> Adversarial attackers
            can manipulate training data to introduce biases, vulnerabilities,
            or backdoors into ML models, leading to inaccurate predictions or
            unauthorized access.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="emphasis">Model Evasion:</span> Adversarial examples
            can be crafted to exploit vulnerabilities in ML models and bypass
            detection or classification systems, potentially leading to false
            positives or negatives.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="emphasis">Privacy Risks:</span> ML & AI systems may
            inadvertently leak sensitive information or violate user privacy
            through data inference, model inversion attacks, or membership
            inference attacks.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="emphasis">Model Stealing:</span> Attackers can
            reverse-engineer ML models or extract proprietary information from
            them by querying the model with carefully crafted inputs and
            observing its responses.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="emphasis">Model Poisoning:</span> Malicious actors can
            inject poisoned data or malicious samples into ML training datasets
            to compromise model integrity, degrade performance, or manipulate
            decision outcomes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="emphasis">Explainability and Interpretability:</span>
            Black-box ML models may lack transparency and interpretability,
            making it difficult to understand their inner workings, detect
            biases, or explain their decisions to stakeholders.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Security Measures for ML & AI:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class="emphasis">Secure Development Practices:</span> Adopt
            secure coding practices and design principles to build robust,
            resilient, and secure ML & AI systems from the ground up.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="emphasis">Data Sanitization:</span> Implement data
            preprocessing and validation techniques to detect and remove
            anomalies, outliers, or malicious inputs from training datasets.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="emphasis">Adversarial Defense:</span> Employ
            adversarial training, robust optimization, or model diversification
            techniques to enhance ML model resilience against adversarial
            attacks.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="emphasis">Privacy-Preserving Techniques:</span> Use
            differential privacy, federated learning, or homomorphic encryption
            to protect sensitive data and preserve user privacy in ML & AI
            systems.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="emphasis">Model Verification and Validation:</span>
            Perform rigorous testing, validation, and verification of ML models
            to ensure correctness, reliability, and safety under various
            conditions and scenarios.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="emphasis">Explainable AI:</span> Develop interpretable
            and explainable ML models that provide insights into their
            decision-making process, rationale, and underlying features.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Future Directions:</h2>
        <p>
          As ML & AI technologies continue to evolve and proliferate, addressing
          security challenges and advancing security measures will be critical
          to unlock their full potential and maximize their societal impact.
          Research efforts in ML & AI security should focus on developing
          innovative techniques, tools, and frameworks to proactively detect,
          prevent, and mitigate emerging threats and vulnerabilities, thereby
          ensuring the trustworthiness, reliability, and safety of ML & AI
          systems in real-world applications.
