      <h1>Incident Response</h1>
      <div class="scrollable-content">
        <p>
          Incident response is the systematic process of detecting, responding
          to, and recovering from security incidents in an organization's IT
          environment. It involves coordinated efforts to minimize the impact of
          incidents, restore normal operations, and prevent future occurrences.
        </p>

        <h2>Key Stages of Incident Response:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class="emphasis">Preparation:</span> Establishing incident
            response policies, procedures, and protocols, including incident
            classification, escalation paths, and communication channels.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="emphasis">Detection and Analysis:</span> Monitoring for
            signs of security incidents, analyzing alerts and anomalies, and
            determining the scope and impact of the incident.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="emphasis">Containment:</span> Taking immediate actions
            to contain the incident, such as isolating affected systems,
            disabling compromised accounts, or blocking malicious traffic.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="emphasis">Eradication:</span> Identifying and removing
            the root cause of the incident, including malware, unauthorized
            access, or configuration weaknesses.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="emphasis">Recovery:</span> Restoring affected systems
            and data to a known good state, implementing security patches and
            updates, and validating the effectiveness of remediation efforts.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="emphasis">Lessons Learned:</span> Conducting
            post-incident reviews and analyses to identify gaps in incident
            response capabilities, document lessons learned, and improve future
            incident response efforts.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Roles and Responsibilities in Incident Response:</h2>

          <li>
            <span class="emphasis">Legal and Compliance:</span> Legal and
            compliance teams ensure that incident response activities comply
            with legal and regulatory requirements, including data breach
            notification laws and industry standards.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="emphasis">Communication:</span> Public relations and
            communications professionals manage external and internal
